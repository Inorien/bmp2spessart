# bmp2spessart

Converts 24bit bmp to the format used by the art system.

# Building

I'm lazy and used VS and C\+\+20, whatever compiler version that supports C\+\+20 is fine, just set bmp2spessart as an executable target with main.cpp as the only source file in whatver system you're using

# Supported images

Right now it lets you do whatever you want but the game will only allow you up to 32x32 working properly. Be sure that your input image is the dimensions you want in-game
